My name is Xinyang, and on behalf of the team, I’d like to extend a warm welcome. You’re here because you’re interested in physics—at least a little—and perhaps curious about the Physics Olympiad. In this post, I’ll share why you might consider tackling physics competitions and how to get started. I’ve learned most of these insights from my seniors, and they’ve been invaluable on my journey.

Ask yourself: Why are you here? Maybe you’re good at physics. Maybe it seems cool. Maybe you’re just doing it to boost your portfolio. When I first started, I didn’t really have an answer. At my school’s inaugural SJPO lesson, I felt completely lost as my seniors dove into circuit problems. They challenged us with the famous cube-resistor problem and spent the entire lesson debating it. After class, I stayed behind to clarify a few doubts. A senior kindly spent an hour working through the math with me—he used Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. His solution was messy, but effective. Just before we wrapped up, he suggested an alternative approach: using equipotential points. I noted this idea and went home to think. Though I doubted I’d solve it, I spent hours sketching diagrams to visualize current flow. Suddenly, everything clicked, and I solved the problem. In that moment, I fell in love with problem solving—the pure joy of thinking.

As I practiced more challenging problems, I improved. The following July, just before my school’s first training cycle ended, another senior asked me the same question I’m asking you now: Why do Physics Olympiad? I told him, “Because it’s fun.” True, but he offered a deeper perspective. Imagine winning an SPhO gold or an IPhO gold—ecstatic and proud, right? But would those feelings last? Probably not. They’re fleeting. So if not for the accolade, why compete? The question echoes a broader one: Why do anything in life? Surely for happiness. But what truly brings lasting happiness? For me, it’s helping others—one of the few sources of sustainable joy. And that’s why I co-founded this programme: to share my knowledge and help you.

A senior once told me that studying physics should be 99% your effort and 1% your teacher’s. I agree—and for beginners, a 70:30 split is more realistic. Your trainers here will provide about 30% of what you need; you must supply the other 70%. Teachers guide you, introduce topics, and help you navigate challenges—but you must give your all before asking for help. After all, “no pain, no gain,” right?

As you embark on this journey, remember that learning is a virtue in itself—and don’t forget to have fun!
